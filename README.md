# The PearBudget Blog
## Code Repository

Since WordPress doesn't have a great means of handling version control, this is a place where I can stash the blog's code as we develop it. Rollbacks won't be quite as granular as git normally allows, but I hope to paste in code snapshots as we go, in case I need to revert to earlier versions.

The blog itself is at http://blog.pearbudget.com/.
